Name: Ryan Wells
Project Name: Character Reader
Project Description:
    A React app that accepts as input a chunk of text
    which is then read out loud character by character via prerecorded audio.
    Helpful post-PoC features might include the ability to upload full text files,
    pause/unpause the recording, export the recording for offline use,
    rewind/fastforward, and recognize every utf8 character.
User Stories:
    As a typist,
    I want to be able to hear my digital copies read out to me
    so that I can proofread them against the analog original
    without having to take my eyes away from the original page,
    as switching focus between two different copies can let errors slip through.
